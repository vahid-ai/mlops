run the pipeline `uv run tools/scripts/run_kronodroid_pipeline.py --destination lakefs --branch main --transform-engine kubeflow --use-kfp-client` until the pipeline successfully completes. When the pipeline is run, constantly poll for the pipelines status until an error or mistakes occurs. Then analyze, apply a fix, clear everything and rerun the pipeline until it successfully completes. For clearing use the se the complete_storage_reset in the notebooks folder to clear the lakefs and minio everytime a new run is tested and clear all previous kubeflow pipelines, pods, or anything else that is old and unneeded, to clear up resources. Also feel free to write custom lakefs, minio or kubectl commands or scripts if needed
